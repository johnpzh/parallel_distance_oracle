Parallel Distance Oracle (PADO)
===============================

A parallel labeling method for shortest distance queries of large complex graphs (such as social networks). The labeling method means the 2-hop labeling plus the pruned landmark labeling. The distance queries are exact distance between any pair of vertices in the graph.
